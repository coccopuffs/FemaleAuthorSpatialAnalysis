# FemaleAuthorship

The code is split into two sections.

1. Python Data Scraping
- I use this code to grab this follow information [author name, institution, location, title of paper, date published]
- I then use this data to use for my spatial analysis done in R

2. R Spatial Analysis
- I use this code to map the proportion of female authors to male authors
- Additionaly to create an additional bar chart figure to represent the distribution of female to male authors in neurosurgey journas

# Current Status

The code is still in work. Specfically, I need to clean up my data scraping to the be used in the R Spatial Analysis
